I like sports programming: time-constrained contests comprised of algorithmic puzzles.

My profiles on some well-known sports programming websites: [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/mnbvmar), [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/mnbvmar), [Topcoder](https://profiles.topcoder.com/mnbvmar).

### Achievements

- I participated in ICPC World Finals twice, together with Wojciech Nadara and Marcin Smulewicz. <br />
_5th place (silver medal) in 2016 (Phuket, Thailand)_ <br />
_2nd place (gold medal) in 2017 (Rapid City, USA)_

- I have the rank of Legendary Grandmaster on Codeforces [profile](https://codeforces.com/profile/mnbvmar) and (at the moment of writing this) a high ranking on AtCoder [profile](https://atcoder.jp/users/mnbvmar).

- I was a finalist of:
  - Google Code Jam, three times: 2016 (New York, 6th place), 2019 (San Francisco, 4th place), 2022 (online, 5th place).<br />
      I also was a Distributed Code Jam finalist in 2016.

### Coaching

In the previous years, I used to coach the teams from the University of Warsaw and prepare them for team programming competitions (ICPC-style, like [AMPPZ](https://amppz.edu.pl/), [CERC](https://cerc24.ii.uni.wroc.pl/), [ICPC World Finals](https://icpc.global/)).
