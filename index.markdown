I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute of Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home),
    in the [Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/algorithms-complexity) group.
My supervisor is [Danupon Nanongkai](https://sites.google.com/site/dannanongkai/).

I did my PhD at the [University of Warsaw](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/en/), advised by [Micha≈Ç Pilipczuk](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~mp248287/).
